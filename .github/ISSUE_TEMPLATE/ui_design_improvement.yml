        ## Acceptance Criteria
        
        When this issue is completed, the following should be implemented:
        
        - [ ] The specified UI area has been improved according to the request
        - [ ] The improvement enhances usability without breaking existing functionality
        - [ ] Changes are responsive and work on both desktop and mobile
        - [ ] The visual design remains consistent with the overall theme
        - [ ] Any accessibility improvements are properly implemented
        
        ## Implementation Hints
        
        - Main styling is in `src/static/styles.css`
        - HTML structure is in `src/static/index.html`
        - JavaScript interactions are in `src/static/app.js`
        - Current color scheme uses CSS custom properties (variables) in `:root`
        - Activity cards are dynamically generated in the `renderActivityCard` function
        - Consider mobile-first responsive design principles
        
        ## Technical Context
        
        - CSS uses modern features like Grid, Flexbox, and CSS custom properties
        - The design follows a card-based layout for activities
        - Color palette includes primary (#1a237e), secondary (#ff6f00), and neutral colors
        - Icons and visual indicators are handled through CSS classes and JavaScript
        - Modal dialogs use CSS transitions for smooth animations
        - Responsive breakpoints should consider tablets and mobile devices
